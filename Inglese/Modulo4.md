## Types of Area Networks (LAN, WAN, MAN)

- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: A network that connects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school, or office building.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: A telecommunications network that extends over a large geographical area for the primary purpose of computer networking.
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: A network that connects users with computer resources in a geographic area larger than that covered by LANs but smaller than WANs.

## Network Standards and Protocols

- **Definition**: Rules and conventions for communication between network devices.
- **Examples**: IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet), IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), TCP/IP, HTTP/HTTPS, FTP.
- **Purpose**: Ensure interoperability and communication among various devices and systems.

## Internet's Protocols

- **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)**: The foundational protocols for the internet.
- **HTTP/HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol/Secure)**: Protocols for transferring web pages on the internet.
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: Protocol used to transfer files between computers on a network.
- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**: Protocol for sending emails.

## The Fundamentals of an Ethernet LAN

- **Definition**: A wired network technology commonly used in local area networks.
- **Components**: Ethernet cables, Network interface cards, Switches, Routers.
- **Standards**: IEEE 802.3.
- **Operation**: Uses packet switching and supports data transfer rates of 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, or 10 Gbps.

## Network Topologies

- **Bus**: All devices share a single communication line. Easy to implement but can be slow and prone to collisions.
- **Star**: All devices are connected to a central hub. Easy to manage but if the hub fails, the entire network is affected.
- **Ring**: Each device is connected to two other devices, forming a ring. Data travels in one direction, and failure of one device can impact the network.
- **Point to Point**: Direct connection between two devices. Simple but not scalable.
- **Mesh**: Every device is connected to every other device. Highly reliable but complex and expensive to implement.

### Discorsivo:

This module covers the fundamentals of network types, standards, and protocols, essential for understanding how computers communicate within and across different areas. LANs, WANs, and MANs represent various scales of networks, from small local networks to vast global connections. Network standards and protocols, such as IEEE 802.3 and TCP/IP, ensure that devices from different manufacturers can communicate effectively, fostering interoperability and seamless data exchange. The core protocols of the internet, like HTTP/HTTPS and FTP, facilitate essential functions such as web browsing and file transfers. Ethernet LANs, based on IEEE 802.3 standards, are widely used for their reliability and speed in local networks. Additionally, understanding different network topologies—bus, star, ring, point-to-point, and mesh—provides insights into the structure and design of networks, each with its advantages and challenges. This knowledge is crucial for designing efficient and robust network infrastructures.

# Traccia personale

Linux itself is not an Operating System, it is a Kernel.
A kernel is the core of the OS, it manage the communication between the software and the hardware components. It's responsible of: Process management, memory allocations, device management and system calls.

Associated with linux comes GNU, which stands for "GNU's not Unix", a free software with the purpose of recreate a Unix-like OS, but free and open source.

The union between linux, created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds and the GNU software released in 1985 by Richard Stallman, are now the base of the most secure, lightweight, Portable and most used in technical application OS.

How it works in practice?

The Linux based OS are called "Linux Distribution" or "Distros".
A Distro is a collection of Software applications, libraries, tool and packet management systems which create a cohesive and functional OS.

Linux is Open Source, so anyone can contribuite to its constant update and make their own personalized OS.<br>
This is the main reason of its wide use in technical subjects.
You can completely make your own OS, you can even rewrite yourself piece of software for fit your necessity. 

Linux is widely used in Server Side application because of its stability, security, cost and performance.

Why its so stable and secure?

Every one can search for vulnerabilities and bugs, someone search them for the making of viruses, but the majority of those who search also use linux and want a secure and stable software. Because of that, when a bug o vulnerability is found, a very large group of people all over the world start fixing it, this leads to the fix of every issues in a few hours from it discovery.
Meanwhile in other OS like Windows or Mac that is not possible, because of their closed source code owned by a big company.
